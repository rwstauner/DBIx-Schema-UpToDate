=head1 DBIx::Schema::UpToDate

This module provides a base class for keeping a database schema up to date.
If you need to make changes to the schema
in remote databases in an automated manner
you may not be able to ensure what version of the database is installed
by the time it gets the update.
This module will apply updates (defined as perl subs (coderefs))
sequentially to bring the database schema
up to the latest version from whatever the current version is.

See module POD for more information.
